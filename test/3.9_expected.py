""" This file will be used as a test. We will run cblack on this file and
compare against expected.py file. If they match, we are good. If not, we have
to see if the change is produced by a change in black behaviour and thus, update
expected.py or the difference is due to a bug in our code.

Feel free to grow this file with more use-cases and update expected.py
